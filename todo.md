## Searching by

- seismic activity / magnitude. 
- average seismic activity/magnitude.
## Properties
- Add latitude and longitude to locations.
## Output
- "x" is the location with the most earthquakes...this needs a date range.
## Interface

## Future goals
- Turn this into a web app. Spring boot?
